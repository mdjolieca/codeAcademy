## Project goals
**Context:** The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. 
In this project, I have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but Iâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, I want to spend the rest of your time relaxing!

## Technology
Project is created with:
 - ES6 Javascript

 

## Source
This project was created by Codecademy for the Full Stack Engineer path.
